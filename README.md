# IPL-Win-Probability

#Introduction

In this project, I use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical IPL match data and predict the Probability of team that is likely to win a given match. The goal is to create a predictive model that can provide insights into the potential outcome of upcoming matches based on various features.
